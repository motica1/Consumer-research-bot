## **Introduction**

This project implements a Generative AI-powered bot designed for **consumer product research**. It leverages state-of-the-art natural language models to assist users in discovering, comparing, and researching products across multiple categories. The bot provides insights on product features, specifications, and reviews, making it easier to make informed purchasing decisions.

With the rise of online shopping, consumers are overwhelmed with options. This AI bot acts as a personal assistant to streamline research, offering personalized recommendations(TBD), answering product-related queries, and generating comparisons based on user input.

---

## **Features**

- **Product Search & Comparison**: Query the bot to find and compare products across different categories, brands, and prices.
- **Product Review Summarization**: Extract and summarize key insights from user reviews on popular e-commerce platforms.
- **Custom Recommendations**: Personalized product recommendations based on user preferences and past interactions.
- **Detailed Product Information**: Provide detailed specs, pros and cons, and feature breakdowns.
- **Conversational Interface**: User-friendly chat interface powered by advanced language models.

## **Architecture**

This bot follows a modular architecture designed for scalability and integration with third-party APIs for product data aggregation. Here's an overview:

- **Natural Language Processing**: Powered by [GPT-4](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4) for understanding and generating human-like responses.
- **Backend**: Built with Python and Flask/Django (or any preferred framework) to handle API calls, requests, and responses.
- **Data Sources**: Integrates with product databases or web scraping APIs (e.g., Amazon, Walmart, BestBuy) to retrieve product details.
- **Recommendation Engine(TBD)**: Personalized suggestions using a machine learning model based on user behavior and interaction history.

## **Usage**

### Starting the Bot
Once you‚Äôve set up the environment and run the application, the bot will be available via a local server.

1. **Access the bot**:
   Open your browser and go to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

2. **Interacting with the Bot**:
   - You can start by asking questions like:
     - ‚ÄúWhat are the best smartphones under $500?‚Äù
     - ‚ÄúCompare the specs of Product A and Product B.‚Äù
     - ‚ÄúSummarize reviews for the latest gaming laptop.‚Äù

### Example Interaction

```bash
User: "What are the top 3 budget laptops?"
Bot: "Here are the top 3 laptops under $600 based on user reviews and specs comparison..."
```

---

## **Customization**

You can customize the bot to meet your specific requirements by modifying its logic or integrating additional APIs.

### Product Data Sources
- **Change APIs**: Modify the product data APIs by editing the `product_api_handler.py` file to include other providers.
  
### NLP & Recommendations
- **Adjust AI Parameters**: Tweak the generative AI settings such as temperature or model version in the `ai_config.py` file.

### UI Customization
- **Frontend(TBD)**: Update the chat interface by editing the `templates/index.html` file if using Flask or the equivalent frontend in your framework.
